Overview

Glioblastoma is a complex malignancy of the brain with intricate genetic makeup. Gene expression patterns though can provide an understanding of its biological mechanisms. 

Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving this disease requires in-depth analysis of gene expression data. In this report, we analyzed gene expression data to:

1. Visualize the relationships among genes and samples using **heatmap clustering**.

2. Identify **upregulated and downregulated genes**.

3. Perform **functional enrichment analysis** using ShinyGO to determine the biological pathways significantly associated with these genes.

4. **Interpret the top 3 enriched pathways** that are relevant to glioblastoma pathogenesis.

**Heatmap Clustering Analysis**

The heatmap analysis, with variations in clustering approaches offers different insights into the structure of the data and underlying biological relationships.
